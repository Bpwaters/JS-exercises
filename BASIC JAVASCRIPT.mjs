.
// Variables can't start with a number or contain spaces
{
    /* You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.

i++;

is the equivalent of

i = i + 1;
} */

{ /* You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by one with the -- operator.

    i--;
    
    is the equivalent of
    
i = i - 1; */ }
